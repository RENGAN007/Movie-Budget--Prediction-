Your dataset contains 3000 entries with 23 columns, including:

- **budget**: The movie's budget (numerical).
- **revenue**: The movie's earnings (numerical).
- **genres**, **cast**, **crew**, **production_companies**, and other categorical and textual data.

### Steps for Visualization and Prediction:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values (columns like `belongs_to_collection`, `genres`, `production_companies`, etc., have missing data).
   - Convert `release_date` to datetime and extract useful features (year, month).
   - Normalize or encode categorical data like `genres`, `production_companies`, etc.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Univariate Analysis**:
     - Distribution of **budget** and **revenue**.
     - Top 10 most common **genres**, **production companies**, etc.
     - Bar plot of movies' **release years**.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**:
     - Scatter plot of **budget vs. revenue**.
     - Correlation heatmap to show relationships between numerical features (e.g., popularity, runtime, budget, revenue).
     - Box plots of revenue for different **genres** or **production companies**.
   
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create features like the **profit** (revenue - budget), **ROI** (revenue / budget), etc.
   - Extract and encode **genres**, **production companies**, and other text-based columns.
   
4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Set up a supervised learning model (regression) to predict **revenue** based on features like **budget**, **popularity**, **runtime**, etc.
   - Try models like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
